For paginated reads, keep the last successful page visible to the user if a
later page fails. Use a bounded page ceiling and stop on a repeated cursor.

## Attribution

`actor`, `proposer`, and `role` fields are declared business attribution. The AI
bearer credential authorizes the AI write surface; it does not authenticate the
named person. Never describe the selected Web role as a signed-in user.
